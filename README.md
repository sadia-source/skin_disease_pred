# Internship Project: Skin Disease Analysis & Prediction
# Context
Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Skin conditions often share similar clinical and histopathological features, making diagnosis challenging and dependent on a detailed assessment of multiple characteristics. By leveraging a combination of clinical and histopathological data, this project aims to develop a predictive model to accurately classify patients into one of six distinct skin disease categories.

# The Problem
Skin disease diagnosis is often complex due to overlapping features across different conditions. Without precise classification, there is an increased risk of misdiagnosis, which can lead to ineffective or even harmful treatment. This project seeks to develop a machine learning model that can predict specific skin conditions based on a comprehensive set of clinical and histopathological features. Such a model can support dermatologists in making quicker, more accurate diagnoses and improve patient care.

# Impact
By automating and improving the accuracy of skin disease classification, this project has the potential to aid healthcare professionals in diagnosing skin conditions, thereby reducing diagnostic errors and improving treatment outcomes. A reliable predictive model could serve as a supplementary diagnostic tool in clinical settings, particularly in regions with limited access to specialist care.

# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

Data Analysis: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of clinical and histopathological features, as well as how these features correlate with the six skin disease classes.
Predictive Modeling: Develop a multiclass classification model that accurately predicts the specific skin condition based on clinical and histopathological features.
Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance in classifying skin diseases, with a focus on precision, recall, and overall accuracy, ensuring that the model meets the requirements for clinical application.

# Dataset Overview
# Features
The dataset consists of 34 columns:

Clinical Features (12 features): These features represent observable clinical characteristics and are categorical, with values ranging from 0 to 3:

0: Absence or minimal effect
1 and 2: Mild effect
3: Severe presence of the feature
Histopathological Features (22 features): These features are based on microscopic examination of tissue samples, also categorical, following the same 0–3 value range as clinical features.

# Age (1 feature): This is the only continuous feature in the dataset and represents the patient’s age in years. It provides additional context that could influence the presentation of certain skin diseases.

# Target Variable
Class (Target Column): The target column is labeled “class” and contains 6 unique values, each representing a distinct skin disease category. This is a multiclass classification problem, as the model needs to predict one of the six classes based on the input features.
# Key Questions to Address
1- How do clinical and histopathological features contribute to the diagnosis of specific skin conditions?
2- Which features are most predictive of each skin disease class?
3- How accurately can the model classify skin conditions based on the given features?
4- What role does age play in distinguishing between different skin conditions?
